# treehouse_student_search
Simple student record search based on a JS treehouse course

# how it works

A prompt shows up to ask a user to type in a name of a student. If the name doesn't exist, the prompt will keep up showing up until the user types in the word 'quit'. If the student exists, their record details will show up on the page.
